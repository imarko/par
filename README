Simple utility to exectue a command for multiple arguments supplied on
stdin, concurrently. Similar to xargs -P or parallel but customized
for my preferences.

Installation: go get github.com/imarko/par

Usage of par:
  -I="...": arg pattern to be replaced with inputs
  -j=20: number of concurrent jobs
  -r=1: try failing jobs this many times

Bugs: the pattern substitution is currently done on a per-word basis
so specifying the substitution pattern in the middle of a word doesn't
work.
