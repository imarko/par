Simple utility to exectue a command for multiple arguments supplied on
stdin, concurrently. Similar to xargs -P or parallel but customized
for my preferences.

Installation: go install github.com/imarko/par

Usage of ./par:
  -b	show bare output without prefix
  -i string
        arg pattern to be replaced with inputs
  -j int
        number of concurrent jobs (default 20)
  -r int
        try failing jobs this many times (default 1)
  -v	verbose output, show task start/finish and exit status
